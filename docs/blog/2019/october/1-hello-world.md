# Pull up a chair!

Hello, stranger, and welcome to my little blog 🎉

First of all, thank you for your interest! I really appreciate you taking some time out of your presumably busy schedule to check out this blog.

If it's your first time here, the purpose of this blog, is for me to note down stuff I've found interesting, stuff I've been playing with or code I want to remember in the future for quick reference.

I might also use this platform for ramblings, although I try to keep most of that on my twitter account, which you can find [here](https://twitter.com/jebkor_)! (shameless self promotion 🤷‍)

Anyway, there is not much else to say in this post, but you can follow me on my different platforms, tha you can find in the footer!

See you around, stranger 👋
